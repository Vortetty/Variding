# Variding
An encoding i wrote in 3 days, written in python, but able to be reasonably adapted to the majority of languages (and in theory all of them if you have less of a life than me)

Requires no libraries

This is [the original](https://github.com/Vortetty/Variding)

New features:
- .vad file, it is a file extension used for files encrypted using Variding. 
  - as par as i can tell no other files should use this file extension
  
Planned features:
- Installer
  - Will add a context item to all files to encode them
  - Will add a contect item to .vad files to decode them

Current versions (showing forks, etc):
- https://github.com/Vortetty/Variding (python)
